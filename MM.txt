Mental Magic for Cockatrice

MM.C.1  This is a ruleset for Mental Magic that makes full use of
        Cockatrice's token-making features.

  MM.C.1a  At the token creation dialog, unchecking the checkbox labeled
           "Destroy token when it leaves the table" causes that token to
           persist in all zones — i.e. to behave like a card.

  MM.C.1b  Giving a token the name of an existing Magic card generates that
           token with the corresponding card image and rules text.

MM.C.2  I recommend that each player uses the following deck:

MM.C.3  All cards start the game unnamed. In most cases, cards in hidden
        zones (i.e. libraries, hands) will be unnamed, and cards in public
        zones (i.e. stack, battlefield, graveyards, exiles) will be named.

  MM.C.3a  Naming a card requires replacing it with a Magic card with the
           same mana cost. Create it as a token — see MM.C.1. Put the old
           card in the exile pile, but consider it no longer to exist.

  MM.C.3b  A previously chosen name can't be chosen again that game.

  MM.C.3c  You may name an unnamed card you own if after doing so:
            * it would enter face-up onto the stack or the battlefield;
            * it would be spliced onto a spell you're casting;
            * an ability it has would go onto the stack, or a delayed
              triggered ability it has would go onto the stack later;
            * or it would be exiled by an effect that couldn't exile it if
              it stayed unnamed, and that would continue to reference it.
           For example, you name a card when Isochron Scepter exiles it.
           On the other hand, you don't name a card when Elkin Bottle
           exiles it; you name it if and when you play it. And you can't
           name Transguild Courier to pay for Force of Will, but you can
           use an unnamed card that's already blue.

  MM.C.3d  You can cast either half of a split card you name.

  MM.C.3e  Some effects exile cards regardless of characteristics, but only
           continue to reference the cards matching some description. For
           the purposes of MM.C.3, consider such effects to reference the
           card(s) regardless of characteristics. So you don't name a card
           when Nivix, Aerie of the Firemind exiles it, but you can name
           it as an instant or sorcery card when you want to cast it.

  MM.C.3f  You may name an unnamed card an opponent owns if an effect you
           control would put that card face-up onto the stack or the
           battlefield under your control, possibly by letting you cast it.
           This rule trumps any rules letting the opponent choose the name.

  MM.C.3g  A named card in a hidden zone becomes unnamed. (Keep the card as
           is; no need to rummage through the exile pile for the original.)

  MM.C.3h  Exceptionally, named basic land cards (see MM.C.5 and MM.C.6)
           stay named for the rest of that game, even in hidden zones.

  MM.C.3i  Some cards have abilities that trigger or are activated from the
           hand, with which the card stays in hand and is temporarily
           revealed — e.g. Miracle, Forecast. In those cases, the card
           stays named as long as it's revealed.

  MM.C.3j  An unnamed card in a graveyard ceases to exist as a state-based
           action. An unnamed card in exile that's no longer referenced by
           any effects ceases to exist as a state-based action. So cards in
           exile that are still significant can be kept on the table, and
           the exile pile will instead be for cards that ceased to exist.

  MM.C.3k  Unnamed cards have no characteristics other than color and mana
           cost. In addition, they do not match any description involving
           card type. For example, neither Ostracize nor Distress can
           discard an unnamed card unless the unnamed card's owner chooses
           to name it as something relevant.

MM.C.4  Certain mana costs have equivalence relations. The transitive
        property does NOT apply. (A=B and B=C don't necessarily imply A=C.)

  MM.C.4a  A card costing {0} (e.g. Ornithopter) may become a card with no
           mana cost (e.g. lands, Evermind), and vice versa.

  MM.C.4b  A multicolor card costing at least one non-hybrid colored mana
           may become any multicolor card costing at least one non-hybrid
           colored mana that has the same converted mana cost.

  MM.C.4c  A card may become any card costing hybrid mana if their mana
           costs would match with some or all of the hybrid mana symbols
           treated as one of their halves, and vice versa. For example,
           a card costing {R}{R}{R}, {2}{R}{R}, {4}{R}, or {6} can become
           Flame Javelin, without restricting how you actually pay if you
           cast it, and if the Flame Javelin somehow ends up back in your
           hand, then it can become any card costing {R}{R}{R}, {2}{R}{R},
           {4}{R}, or {6}.

  MM.C.4d  For the purposes of matching mana symbols, treat phyrexian mana
           symbols as non-phyrexian mana symbols of the same color.
           Unlike the other equivalence relations, this one IS transitive.

MM.C.5  Once per turn, the active player may name and play an unnamed card
        as Utopia:

        Utopia
        Basic Land — Utopia
        (Utopia is an additional land type that exists in Mental Magic
        games; Utopia is not a basic land type.)
        {T}: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.

  MM.C.5a  Doing so counts as playing a land, but effects that allow you to
           play additional land in a turn don't let you name Utopia again.

  MM.C.5b  For convenience, use shift-drag to play the card face-down.
           There's no need to replace the card with a Utopia token unless
           it somehow leaves the battlefield, in which case do create a
           Utopia token (uncheck "Destroy token when it leaves the table")
           and put the old card in the exile pile.

MM.C.6  When searching a library, you may also find Basic Land cards (not
        Utopia). Create them as tokens (uncheck "Destroy token...").

MM.C.7  Bans

  MM.C.7a  vivafringe recommends banning cards restricted in Vintage;
           ntillerman recommends banning cards banned in Legacy.

  MM.C.7b  Cards that ask you to reveal cards from a library until a card
           meeting certain conditions is revealed (e.g. Tainted Pact, Mind
           Funeral) are banned.

  MM.C.7c  Dark Depths is banned.

  MM.C.7d  Illusionary Mask and cards with Morph are banned. We might unban
           them in the future when we have satisfactory rules for them.
